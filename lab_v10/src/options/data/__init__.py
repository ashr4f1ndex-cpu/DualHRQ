"""Data adapters and pipeline components for the options strategy.

This subpackage contains loader functions for vendor datasets
(e.g. CBOE, IvyDB), a synthetic options chain adapter, and a
pipeline adapter for constructing feature matrices from price and
volatility data.  Declaring this file ensures Python treats the
directory as a package.
