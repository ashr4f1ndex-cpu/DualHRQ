"""Intraday strategy package for the dual‑book trading lab.

This package contains utilities for detecting intraday patterns
(e.g., parabolic blow‑offs), aggregating intraday diagnostics to
daily features, and simulating the intraday short strategy.  The
presence of this file allows the `intraday` directory to be
imported as a Python package, enabling unit tests to locate
modules via relative imports.
